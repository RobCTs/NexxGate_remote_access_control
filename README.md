## Brief description
NexxGate is an innovative access control solution designed to enhance security and flexibility across various environments. Leveraging the power of NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, biometrics and the robust ESP32 microcontroller, NexxGate enables secure, keyless entry to buildings, rooms, and other secure areas. This project combines the convenience of NFC tags/cards with the extended range and reliability of LoRa (Long Range) communication, making it ideal for applications where traditional Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connectivity might fall short.
