## Brief description
NexxGate is an innovative access control solution designed to enhance security and flexibility across various environments. Leveraging the power of NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, biometrics and the robust ESP32 microcontroller, NexxGate enables secure, keyless entry to buildings, rooms, and other secure areas. This project combines the convenience of NFC tags/cards with MQTT communication, also implementing a web interface for user management and access control. NexxGate is a versatile solution that can be easily adapted to different scenarios, such as homes, offices, metro stations, and industrial facilities.
